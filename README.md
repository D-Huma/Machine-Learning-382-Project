# Machine-Learning-382-Project
We were tasked to create different machine learning models that would be able to predict the median house values of homes in the Western Cape. 
The house values would be influenced by a number of factors, of which, we had to decide which of these factors would be the most useful for each of our models.
For this project, the chosen models were: The Random Forest model, K-Means Algorithm and Logistic Regression
